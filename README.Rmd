Getting and Cleaning Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Required Steps
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps in code for analysis.
Downloading and unzipping appropriate files was performed.
read.table is used as the files were in .txt format.
One data frame was produced using function rbind,cbind.
grep searching pattern mean,std.
Tidy data  created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject based on the data.
Data written to file using write.table
